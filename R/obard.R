#' Estimates for the maximum sizes of amenity (and other, non-forestry) trees
#' are important for urban planning and tree management. This report presents
#' the findings of an applied research study to generate current best estimates
#' for UK tree typical sizes and allometric equations. This report contains
#' typical mature sizes for 46 species and 29 genera of trees commonly found in
#' the UKâ€™s towns, cities and land outside of woodland. While the data come from
#' sites across the UK in both urban and rural areas, the data were all
#' collected as part of professional tree surveys and so are likely to be
#' representative of amenity trees. Trees grown in woodland conditions are not
#' likely to be well represented by the models presented here. This report also
#' contains allometric model formulae for up to 23 species (depending on the
#' relationship), allowing tree characteristics such as diameter at breast
#' height to be predicted by other measured parameters. The formulae can be
#' used in Excel (or other software) for prediction.
#'
#' What does the document contain?
#' (1) Summary of methods used to generate the values and equations
#' (2) Typical and large (95th percentile) crown radius, height, diameter at
#' breast height and root protection radius for UK amenity tree species and
#' genera
#' (3) Plots to show these values
#' (4) Coefficients for single-parameter allometric equations.
